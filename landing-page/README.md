An example of employing JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) is illustrated in the Landing Page Project, where the following actions are performed:

- Creation of new components that mirror the styles and structure of the main menu.
- Adjustment of functionality and styling for both active and inactive items.
- Implementation of automatic scrolling upon clicking.




Create a navigation menu in the header that dynamically adapts based on the sections added to the `index.html` file.
- When a specific area is chosen in the navigation menu, the page will smoothly scroll to that section.
- The activated section and its corresponding entry in the navigation menu will undergo design changes to indicate their active status.
- Upon selecting a different section, the previously activated area and its counterpart in the navigation menu will revert to their original appearance.




- The original `index.html` and `css/styles.css` are provided by [Udacity].
- The original `index.html` provided by [Udacity] has 3 sections and 3 other sections were added to test the functionality of adding new navigation menu items automatically.
- All other development features -including CSS new rules- are done in `js/app.js`.
